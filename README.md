## 🤔 What is 3R4?

3R4-OS, or 3R4, is an open-source project that enhances Windows by conveniently applying privacy, usability, and performance optimizations, all while maintaining functionality and [customizability](https://docs.atlasos.net/getting-started/post-installation/atlas-folder/general-configuration/).

## 👀 Why 3R4?
### 🔒 Enhanced Privacy
3R4 removes the majority of telemetry embedded within Windows and implements numerous group policies to minimize data collection. However, it cannot ensure privacy outside the scope of Windows, such as browsers and other third-party applications.

### 📈 Optimized Performance
3R4 strikes a balance between performance and compatibility. It implements numerous meaningful changes to improve Windows performance and responsiveness without breaking essential features. 3R4 will not do tweaks for a placebo effect or marginal gains, making 3R4 more stable and compatible.

### 🛡️ Security Features
Most Windows modifications remove key security features most users need to maintain a secure system. On the other hand, 3R4 allows users to customize their security at their own risk while informing users about each option's [pros and cons](https://docs.atlasos.net/getting-started/post-installation/atlas-folder/security/).

Some optional security features are:

- Windows Defender & SmartScreen
- Windows Update
  - Automatic updates are togglable
- CPU mitigations
- User Account Control
- Core isolation features

### ✅ Increased Usability
3R4 applies many modifications and default settings to make Windows easier to use. This includes removing commonly unneeded applications (which are reinstallable), configuring many aspects of the interface, disabling advertisements, and much more.

### 🔍 Open Source and Transparent

Unlike custom Windows ISOs, 3R4 is more straightforward to audit due to the use of [AME Wizard](https://ameliorated.io). AME Wizard is controlled by Playbooks, a customizable script-esque system that can perform various tasks.

Playbooks are renamed **.zip** archives, with the password [`malte`](https://docs.ameliorated.io/developers/getting-started/creation.html). As they primarily consist of plain text, Playbooks enable transparency, unlike custom Windows ISOs, which have many entry points for malicious activity. The few binaries in the Playbook are open source in our [`utilities` repository](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/utilities), with the [hashes listed here](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas/blob/main/src/playbook/Executables/AtlasModules/README.md).

Although the GUI is not open source for AME Wizard, AME Wizard's entire backend (called [TrustedUninstaller](https://github.com/Ameliorated-LLC/trusted-uninstaller-cli)) is open source under MIT, which contains each action used to run 3R4. The 3R4 Playbook is open source under the [GPLv3 license](https://github.com/3R4-TBNKZ/3R4-OS/blob/main/LICENSE).

### 🔒 Legal Compliance
As 3R4 doesn't redistribute a modified Windows ISO, it complies with [Windows's Usage Terms](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/useterms/#areaheading-uid6738235). In addition, 3R4 does not alter activation in Windows.
